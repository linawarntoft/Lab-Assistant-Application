# Lab Assistant 
The Lab Assistant application was first developed as a final project of a C# course but has now taken
on its own life by giving a helping hand in lab environments. The application includes a log-book part
and a stage manager part, that specifically is built to work as an easy interface to manage Thorabs' Linear
Tranlation Stage (lts-150).

## Download
Download the entire *Releases* folder to your preferred location on your machine and unzip the downloaded zip-folder. Double click *Setup.exe* and wait. You are now done and good to go!

## Updates
The application is still a work in progress and updates will occur frequently within the next few month.

*Latest update:* 2020-06-11 

- Version 1.0.3
- The application now has an updated icon.
- There are still issues with the Thorlabs libraries and therefore the stage manager is currently not functioning.
